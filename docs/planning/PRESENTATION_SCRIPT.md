**(Image: A complex screenshot of Evony with lots of things happening)**

**Presenter:**

> "Evony is a complex game. Managing resources, coordinating attacks, tracking enemies, and optimizing growth across multiple accounts is a monumental task. Players often struggle with:

> - **Information Overload**: Too much data, not enough insight.
> - **Repetitive Tasks**: Endless cycles of gathering, training, and building.
> - **Strategic Blindness**: Making decisions without a clear understanding of the consequences.
> - **Siloed Tools**: Juggling multiple applications, scripts, and spreadsheets.

> What if there was a better way?"

## Slide 4: Feature 1 - Live Game State Engine

**(Image: A diagram showing data flowing from the game into the Game State Engine)**

**Presenter:**

> "At the heart of Svony Browser is the **Live Game State Engine**. It works by intercepting and parsing all game traffic in real-time, creating a complete, in-memory model of your game.

> This isn’t just data; it’s a living, breathing representation of your cities, heroes, troops, resources, and marches. Every action, every update, every event is captured and understood.

> **(DEMO)**
> *Show the main window. Point to the resource counters at the top.*
> "Notice these resource counters? They aren’t just numbers. They are directly tied to the Game State Engine. When I collect resources in the game... *(perform collection)*... you see the numbers update instantly. This is the foundation for everything else we’re about to see."

## Slide 5: Feature 2 - AI Strategic Advisor

**(Image: A screenshot of the Chatbot Panel showing a strategic recommendation)**

**Presenter:**

> "With a complete understanding of your game state, we can now provide **AI-powered strategic advice**. Our Strategic Advisor analyzes your current situation and provides personalized recommendations for growth, combat, and resource management.

> It can generate optimized daily activity plans, suggest build orders, and even analyze potential attack targets.

> **(DEMO)**
> *Open the Chatbot Panel.*
> "I can simply ask the AI, ‘What should I upgrade next?’... * (type the question)* ... and it analyzes my current buildings, resources, and research to provide a prioritized list. It’s like having a professional coach available 24/7."

## Slide 6: Feature 3 - Full Combat Simulator

**(Image: A screenshot of the Combat Simulator UI with a battle result)**

**Presenter:**

> "Tired of guessing battle outcomes? Our **Full Combat Simulator** uses Monte Carlo analysis to predict battle results with over 85% accuracy. It calculates losses, predicts loot, and even recommends the optimal troop composition for victory.

> **(DEMO)**
> *Open the Combat Simulator.*
> "Let’s simulate an attack. I’ll input my troops... and the defender’s troops. The simulator runs thousands of scenarios in seconds and gives me a clear prediction: Victory, with an 87% confidence level, and estimated losses of around 7,000 troops. It even suggests adding 10,000 more cavalry to push that to 95% confidence. No more blind attacks."

## Slide 7: Feature 4 - Intelligent Auto-Pilot

**(Image: A screenshot of the Auto-Pilot configuration panel)**

**Presenter:**

> "Let’s talk about the grind. Our **Intelligent Auto-Pilot** can manage routine tasks for you, while respecting game rules and your personal preferences. It can handle building, training, gathering, and collecting resources automatically.

> You can define strategies, set safety limits, and let the AI handle the rest.

> **(DEMO)**
> *Open the Auto-Pilot panel.*
> "Here, I can enable tasks like ‘collect resources’ and ‘train troops’. I can set safety limits, like keeping a minimum of 100,000 gold in reserve. Once I click ‘Start’, Svony Browser takes over the mundane tasks, freeing me up to focus on strategy."

> You can switch between accounts instantly, transfer resources from farms to your main, and, most importantly, launch coordinated rally attacks with perfect timing.

> **(DEMO)**
> *Show the Multi-Account dashboard.*
> "Here are my three accounts. I can see their status at a glance. With one click, I can initiate a mass resource transfer. Or, I can select my main and two farm accounts, choose a target, and schedule a rally attack. The orchestrator will handle the rest, ensuring all marches launch simultaneously."

## Slide 9: Feature 6 - Real-Time Map Intelligence

**(Image: A screenshot of the world map with custom overlays)**

**Presenter:**

> We can show player activity heatmaps, alliance territories, and high-value targets, all in real-time.

> **(DEMO)**
> *Show the map view.*
> "Here’s the world map. I can enable layers to see enemy activity, resource distribution, and potential farm targets. I can filter for players with low power and no alliance, making it easy to find my next target."
